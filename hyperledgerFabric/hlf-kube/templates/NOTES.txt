{{ if .Values.backup.enabled }}

HL Fabric network is now prepared for backup!

Wait for all pods are up and running then run the backup Argo flow!
After that is completed, make another Helm upgrade to return back to normal operation.

{{- if (index .Values "hlf-kafka").enabled }}

IMPORTANT: Looks like you are using Kafka Orderer. 
In this case you also need to manually backup Kafka cluster!

Happy BlockChaining :)

And don't forget the first rule of BlockChain club:

"Do not use BlockChain unless absolutely necessary!"
