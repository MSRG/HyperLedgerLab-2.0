This is the main Helm chart to configure and launch the HL Fabric network. 
It's also used for transitioning between normal operation and backup/restore modes.

This chart can also optionally deploy a Kafka cluster as part of this chart.

Please refer to [README](../../README.md) in the top level directory and also 
inline comments in the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file for how to use this chart.
